Beginner's Gudie - KoekoEdu Feature Impact Analysis
================

### Getting Started - SQL
Before this project, i didn't have SQL setup on my latop, so i had to set it up. Here are the resources that i used to guide me through that:
1. Install MySQL - [video](https://youtu.be/Sfvpgu9ID2Q?si=wPrhT8c4P1yA5eXf) \
**NB**: You can stop at 6:47. No need to create the new database as the video did.
2. Undertanding how the MySQL workbench interface works video - [video](https://youtu.be/gPxiIBa59ZY?si=_SOsmK2DBUxjktIq)
3. Load in database into MySQL Workbench - [video](https://youtu.be/JgUuR67zvQg?si=V2u2aixZualw2xg9)
4. Create an ERD diagram - [video](https://youtu.be/pk_vtR28TyY?si=LJ9K0e41U-nKZ_4S)
5. connecting mysql to vscode - [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ADd-_mM5Dw)
   
### Data Extraction, Probabilities and Dependacies - SQL
If you'd like to just outright take a quick course on SQL, i'll suggest udacity's free SQL course. It's the very first SQL course I took back in 2021 or so and it completely free. You can access it [here](https://www.udacity.com/course/sql-for-data-analysis--ud198).

However, if you don't have the time to take an entire course, these are the SQL commands/concepts you'll need for this part of the project:

### Data Preprocessing - Python
For this section of the project, 
1. Creating subplots - [article](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/subplots_axes_and_figures/subplots_demo.html), [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuPBzxTA-nA)
2. kde plots - [documentation](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.kdeplot.html#seaborn.kdeplot)
3. Removing outliers with quantiles - [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sJaRHF03K8)
4. Exporting data with to_csv - [article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/saving-a-pandas-dataframe-as-a-csv/)
5. Understanding Skewness - [article](https://www.scribbr.co.uk/stats/skewness-meaning/)
 
### Descriptive Statistics - Excel
To correctly attempt this video, you'll need to understanding the relationship between skewness, mean and median. I wrote a short article explaining that. You can access it [here](https://tinyurl.com/bdemm5w4)

Also, just incase you don't know, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A8dAYeulL4) is a video explaining how to calculate measures of central tendacy in Excel.

### Confidence Intervals - Excel
Confidence intervals provide a range of values within which a population parameter is likely to lie, based on sample data. I wrote a short teaching note on this concept. You can access it [here](). 

You'll ned to plot a barchart with error bars too. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1R3-MFHER0) a video to help you figure that part out

### Hypothesis Testing - Excel
Hypothesis Testing is a method used to determine whether there is enough evidence in a sample of data to infer that a certain condition is true for the entire population. I wrote a very simple article on this concept and it contains all you need to attempt this section of the project. You can access it [here](https://medium.com/@themieadeyelu/that-very-simple-guide-to-hypothesis-testing-aaab3195b429).

### Probabilities and Dependacies
You'll ned to understand the concept of conditional probabilty to work on this section of this project. You'll need to do some research on them and how they can be used to determine whether two events are dependent or independent. Here are two videos to get you started - [video one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibINrxJLvlM), [video two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IgyaD7vOOA), [video three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUDhRX_wV78&t=4s)

### Machine Learing Modeling and Deployment
[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AJT-RND5NQ) is a very simple and direct video that put through the very process of carrying out linear regression. 
Then chapter five of DataTalk's machine learning course covers a guide for model deployment. You can access the repository [here](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/machine-learning-zoomcamp/tree/master/05-deployment)
